		<h2>About the Project</h2>
		This project addresses the United States National Parks. There are National Parks found throughout the USA. Therefore, through a series of maps, the an overview of each park can be seen before focusing on a single National Park. The National Park that will be focused on in the second half of the project is the Badlands National Park. At this site a series of maps will display the location of the park in South Dakota, the vegetation at the site, and select archaeological sites/work that has been conducted within the park by the National Park Service.

		<h3>National Parks Overview</h3>
		This map displays all of the National Parks found in the United States as defined by the National Park Service. The primary focus of this map is the parks found in the states themselves. Therefore, the data was filtered to remove any parks found within the US territories such as the Virgin Islands or American Samoa. This map can be viewed below.

		<h3>South Dakota National Parks</h3>
		This map is a zoomed in version of the larger National Parks Overview. It displays the National Parks within the state of South Dakota. All of the parks are found within the western side of the state. There are five total parks of varying sizes: Badlands National Park, Mount Rushmore National Memorial, Wind Cave National Park, Jewel Cave National Monument, and Minuteman Missile National Historic Site. This map can be viewed below.

		<h3>Badlands National Park Vegetation</h3>
		The Badlands National Park Vegetation Map displays the wide variety of vegetation that is present in and around the Badlands National Park. I utilized Geospatial vegetation data from the National Park Service for this particular park. I specifically imported the "BADL_VegPolys" from the zip file as this contained the vegetation data. Then, I viewed the attributes table to identify the attribute that labeled the types of vegitation. In this case, it was the "MapUnit_Name". Therefore, in the symbology tab, I used the "MapUnit_Name" to categorize the vegetation. Because there is a wide variety of vegetation in this park, I felt it was best to use the random color generator. I randomized a few times to find a color combonation that I felt went well together. Ultimately, there were many types of vegetation, and while I contomplated eliminating some types from the categories and merging the eliminated with the "others" category, I felt this would decrease the accuracy of the map. Although I have visited and lived in the area, I do not know enough about vegetation to accurately eliminate one over another. Therefore, I left all types of vegetation in the map. Additionally, in contrast to my previous maps, I made the borders of the national park white so the boundaries are still visible while still viewing the park's vegetation as the geospatial data displays vegetation from outside the park boudaries as well. This map can be viewed below.

			<h4>About the Map's Vegetation</h4>
			Within the Badlands National Park, the most popular vegetation is the "Badlands Sparse Vegetation Complex", which is represented by a light green color. In addition, the Prarie Sandreed Shrub Grassland and Prarie Dog Town Complex are highly abundant. They are represented by a baby blue and a teal, respectively. Outside the boundaries of the park, Crop Lands and Pasture, which is represented by and orange, and the Western Wheatgrass Shrubland, represented by a light pink, are highly abundant. Below is an image of the Badlands from the National Park Service. It displays the Badlands and the Badlands Sparse Vegetation Complex.

		<h3>Focused Badlands Archaeological Sites</h3>
		The Badlands National Park has a long history. However, due to the harsh environment in the area that has led to heavy erosion of the geological features, archaeology has been diffcult to practice within the Badlands according the the National Park Service as archaeological materials quickly disappear in the harsh winds. Despite that, the NPS states that over 300 archaeological sites have been identified within the park. Non of these sites are the location of permanant habitation. Evidence, such as charcoal, bison bone, and worked stone, suggest these identified locations were temporary camps for hunters and gatherers. In addition, the occasional piece of pottery is identified at sites.

		The map below focuses on the eastern corner of the Badlands National Park. By zooming in from the overview of the Badlands, we can focus on the details within portion of the park, such as the vegetation in this area. Similar to the previous vegetation map, the "Badlands Sparse Vegetation Complex" is the most abundant vegetation throughout the eastern corner of the Badlands National Park. In addition, there is also a high level of "Western Wheatgrass Grassland Alliance". 
		<p></p>
		This section was chosen because of archaeological work that was done in the area in the late 1990's and early 2000s. In a joint undertaking by the National Park Service (NPS) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), four archaeological excavations were conducted. Two are visible on this section of the map. They are labeled with the titles Cedar Pass and North Enterance.
